        <p>Hello, whoever is reading this. As you can tell, my name is Jonathan Joseph. 
            When I was 2 years old, there was an earthquake in Haiti that drastically changed the trajectory of my life, since my mother planned for me to grow up there. 
            Following the earthquake, my mother sent me to America, where I have spent most of my life, except for two trips I went to Haiti.
            I am currently 17 years old and taking classes at New England Institute of Technology through the ECP. So far, it has been a fantastic decision. 
            I've met new people, and the freedom we are given is really lovely, and so is the food. But my true goal with the ECP is to get a jumpstart on college and my career, if 
            I can get a summer internship, which would be open to a "freshman". </p>
