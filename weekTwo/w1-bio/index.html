    <p>Hello, whoever is reading this. As you can tell, my name is <strong>Jonathan Joseph</strong>. 
        When I was <b>2 years old</b>, there was an earthquake in <i>Haiti</i> that drastically changed the trajectory of my life, 
        since my mother planned for me to grow up there. Following the earthquake, my mother sent me to America, 
        where I have spent most of my life, except for two trips I went to Haiti.
        I am currently 17 years old and taking classes at <em>New England Institute of Technology</em> through the ECP.
        Visit my school here:

            For <b>all</b> of my schooling I have gone to the same K–12 school, <strong>Times2 STEM Academy</strong>.

            I have done different summer school programs; the first I ever did, during my rising 6th grade summer, 
            was <i>Generation STEAM Teach Academy</i> (GTSA). It was a program for K–8 students and I really enjoyed it.

            I have participated with <em>Brown Pre-College</em>. It was fun, but the coursework was intense.  
            I chose a class on the rule of law because I thought I wanted to practice law, but that course helped me realize 
            I don’t want to do that much reading constantly, even though I still enjoy reading.

    <ul>
        <li>
            My favorite hobby is <strong>skateboarding</strong>. I started last year after my sister got me my first board.  
            It was scary at first since skateboards don’t have brakes, and I fell a few times.

        <li>
            I also like to practice coding problems on <em>LeetCode</em>.  
            I don’t always keep up with my daily goal, but I enjoy thinking through each challenge.
