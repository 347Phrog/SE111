            <span class="indented">If</span> a character from <i><span class="sfText">Street Fighter</span></i>
            such as <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> were to encounter
            <span class="tekkenText">Jin Kazama</span>&nbsp; from
            <em class="tekkenText">Tekken</em>,&nbsp;
            <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> might be able to put up a fight if it
            wasn't for the fact that <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            exists within the 3rd dimension.&nbsp; As humans, we are 3-dimensional
            creatures can move forward (x plane), upward (y plane), and sideways (z plane)
            plane.&nbsp; Logically <span class="sfText">Ryu</span>&nbsp;
            wouldn't be able to perceive <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            since beings cannot perceive dimensions greater than their own. In Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, time is characterized as the 4th dimension, something we humans cannot perceive. In <em class="intText">Interstellar</em>, one of the main protagonists goes into the black hole Gargantua and interacts with the path, which essentially sets the story in motion.

                 <span class="indented intText"><em>Interstellar</em></span> is a story which takes place in the year 2067 <!-- add a meme here--> and humanity is on its last leg because there was a global blight which killed most crops. The main protagonist, Joseph A. Cooper, was a NASA pilot but is now a farmer because the population is so in need of food.&nbsp; Although I didn't fully understand the plot of <em class="intText">Interstellar</em> I really did like the movie,&nbsp; it was the only piece of media I have ever cried to, during the scence of Cooper watching time fly past him, and his daughter become the same one who was 10 years old when he left on his mission,&nbsp; turn 33 years old. I think my favorite charecter in the fill would be TARS, at first I thought he was going to turn evil, but I started to like "him" 
                 more and more as the movie went on.

        <h2 class="conjText"><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em> Review</h2>

            <p class="conjText">
            
            <span class="indented"><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em></span> was actually the first movie from the <em>The Conjuring</em> series that I've ever watched, and honestly, I didn't like it much. I didn't have any idea what I was going into, except that I knew other movies in the series were scary, and that this would be my first "real" scary movie, or so I thought.The scares were always lackluster, felt really basic and predictable, except for the scene in the basement, which, in all fairness, did scare me a little bit. Other than that the movie as a whole didn't have the creepy atmosphere I expected from such a famous horror series.
            I also couldn't tell what was going on with the story, and all the back and forth at the start of the movie, and all in all I couldn't tell what was going on other than the, ending of the movie where the used the power of friedship cliche to defeat whatever spirt was in the Mirror.
            Overall, <em class="conjText">The Conjuring: Last Rites</em> felt like a waste of money and time, which sucks since I went in hoping it'd finally get me into the series.

                        It is based on the real-life alleged haunting of the Smurl family in West Pittston, Pennsylvania.

                    <li>
                        It is slated to be the final film in the mainline series featuring Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren.

                    <li>    
                        Like the real-life versions of themselves, Ed and Lorraine have a room in their house filled with objects that are either cursed or have been used in some paranormal event or ritual.
