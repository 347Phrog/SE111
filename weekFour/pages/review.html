            <span class="indented">If</span> a character from <i><span class="sfText">Street Fighter</span></i>
            such as <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> were to encounter
            <span class="tekkenText">Jin Kazama</span>&nbsp; from
            <em class="tekkenText">Tekken</em>,&nbsp;
            <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> might be able to put up a fight if it
            wasn't for the fact that <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            exists within the 3rd dimension.&nbsp; As humans, we are 3-dimensional
            creatures can move forward (x plane), upward (y plane), and sideways (z plane)
            plane.&nbsp; Logically <span class="sfText">Ryu</span>&nbsp;
            wouldn't be able to perceive <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            since beings cannot perceive dimensions greater than their own. In Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, time is characterized as the 4th dimension, something we humans cannot perceive. In <em>Interstellar</em>, one of the main protagonists goes into the black hole Gargantua and interacts with the path, which essentially sets the story in motion.

            <span class="indented"><em>Interstellar</em></span> is a story which takes place in the year 2067 <!-- add a meme here--> and humanity is on its last leg because there was a global blight which killed most crops. The main protagonist, Joseph A. Cooper, was a NASA pilot but is now a farmer because the population is so in need of food.&nbsp; Although I didn't fully understand the plot of <em>Interstellar</em> I really did like the movie,&nbsp; it was the only piece of media I have ever cried to, during the scence of Cooper watching time fly past him, and his daughter become the same one who was 10 years old when he left on his mission,&nbsp; turn 33 years old.
