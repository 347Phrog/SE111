            <span class="indented">If</span> a character from <i><span class="sfText">Street Fighter</span></i>
            such as <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> were to encounter
            <span class="tekkenText">Jin Kazama</span>&nbsp; from
            <em class="tekkenText">Tekken</em>,&nbsp;
            <span class="sfText">Ryu</span> might be able to put up a fight if it
            wasn't for the fact that <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            exists within the 3rd dimension.&nbsp; As humans, we are 3-dimensional
            creatures can move forward (x plane), upward (y plane), and sideways (z plane)
            plane.&nbsp; Logically <span class="sfText">Ryu</span>&nbsp;
            wouldn't be able to perceive <span class="tekkenText">Jin</span>&nbsp;
            since beings cannot perceive dimensions greater than their own. In Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, time is characterized as the 4th dimension, something we humans cannot perceive. In <em class="intText">Interstellar</em>, one of the main protagonists goes into the black hole Gargantua and interacts with the path, which essentially sets the story in motion.

            <span class="indented intText"><em>Interstellar</em></span> is a story which takes place in the year 2067 <!-- add a meme here--> and humanity is on its last leg because there was a global blight which killed most crops. The main protagonist, Joseph A. Cooper, was a NASA pilot but is now a farmer because the population is so in need of food.&nbsp; Although I didn't fully understand the plot of <em class="intText">Interstellar</em> I really did like the movie,&nbsp; it was the only piece of media I have ever cried to, during the scence of Cooper watching time fly past him, and his daughter become the same one who was 10 years old when he left on his mission,&nbsp; turn 33 years old. I think my favorite charecter in the fill would be TARS, at first I thought he was going to turn evil, but I started to like "him" 
            more and more as the movie went on.

                <h3> <span class="intText"><em>Interstellar</em></span> Trivia</h3>
                <ul class="intText">
                    <li>Each tick in the background of the Interstellar soundtrack during the Millerâ€™s Planet scene represents one day passing on Earth</li>
                    <li>Dr. Mann was named that way due to the fact he is meant to symbolize humanity's nature </li>
                    <li>TARS actor Bill Irwin recorded all his lines on-set. He did this by speaking into a headset (whilst operating the TARS puppet), where the sound was then played through a built-in speaker in the physical TARS puppet.</li>
