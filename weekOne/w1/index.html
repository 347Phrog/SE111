        With the basic's out of the way, I really love this 
        video beacause of the way this song speaks to me
        <a href="https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo" target="_blank">watch it here.</a>
        On a serious note growing up I really loved watching a youtuber by the name of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w4zzVPJ4WU" target="_blank" >stampylonghead</a> but I definitely liked watching
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_vGAPvjOc8" target="_blank">DanTDM</a> more.
