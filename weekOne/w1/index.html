        Hello, as you can tell, my name is <b>Jonathan</b>, but my family usually just calls me <i>John</i>. 
        I like skateboarding, and obviously <u>coding</u> too, and want to pursue a career in software engineering, 
        or and just make enough not to have to worry about how I am going to pay my <b><i><u>coding</u></i></b>

        With the basics out of the way, I really love this 
        video because of the way this song speaks to me
        <a href="https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo" target="_blank">watch it here.</a>
        On a serious note, growing up, I really loved watching a YouTuber by the name of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w4zzVPJ4WU" target="_blank" >stampylonghead</a> but I definitely liked watching
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_vGAPvjOc8" target="_blank">DanTDM</a> more.

        I couldn't think of a good image to use as a link to something, so here 
        is a link to the Balatro Steam page (gambling is life)
